            <h2 class="heading2">3 episodes where I have faced an issue/ challenges:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>During my final year project at University, I decided to take on the challenge of learning CAD SolidWorks despite having no prior knowledge of the software. I only had 12 weeks in my design phase so had to self-teach myself to a sufficient level to be able to design a high-quality aircraft wing design for later testing.</li>
                <li>During the Covid pandemic whilst working at Tesco, we had many vulnerable staff who were required to isolate along with further staff who contracted the virus. This left us very short-staffed and in a position where we had to recruit temporary staff on an emergency basis. I was responsible for delivering the training to our new recruits to develop them to an accpetable standard for our store however in a much shorter time period than normal. </li>
